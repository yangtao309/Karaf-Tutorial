\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This bundle provides JMX classes loaded during Karaf boot process.

    In particular it provides the KarafMBeanServerBuilder.

    The KarafMBeanServerBuilder builds a special MBeanServer that allows role-based authorization
    for JMX access.
    This class must be loadable from at startup by the JVM so this module is added to classpath, the
    the boot delegation class path and made available via the system bundle.
