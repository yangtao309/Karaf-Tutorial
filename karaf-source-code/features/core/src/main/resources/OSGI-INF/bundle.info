h1. Description

This bundle is the core implementation of the Karaf features support.

Karaf provides a simple, yet flexible, way to provision applications or "features". Such a mechanism is mainly
provided by a set of commands available in the features shell. The provisioning system uses xml "repositories"
that define a set of features.
